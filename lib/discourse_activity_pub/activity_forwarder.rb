See "7.1.2 Forwarding from Inbox": https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#inbox-forwarding

We are intentionally violating the second requirement of "7.1.2 Forwarding from Inbox" by always 
forwarding public activities to the topic's remote audience, even if that audience is not included in the 
original activity's addressing. The thinking here is that reply-chain integrity, particularly for
the original topic, is more important in the context of a forum topic than it is in the context 
that 7.1.2, and "stream" implementations like Mastodon, seem to assume. Compare:
https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/5631#issuecomment-343039649

This will not forward Likes from Mastodon, as they are (intentionally) not publicly addressed
by Mastodon. See further: https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/11339
